# SE_PROJECT_AFE
A simple embedded project that detects fire using an IR sensor and automatically activates a fire extinguisher. 
Automatic fire detection and extinguishing system using IR sensor for quick safety response.
This is a mini project that automatically detects fire using an IR flame sensor and extinguishes it with a 3V water pump. 
The circuit is built using simple electronic components (no microcontroller), making it cost-effective and beginner-friendly.
When fire is detected, the IR receiver triggers a BC547 transistor, which powers the water pump and LED indicator. 
The system is powered by a 3.7V Li-ion battery with a TP4056 charging module for recharging.
